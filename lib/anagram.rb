# You'll need to iterate over the array of words that the
# .match method takes as an argument. You will compare each word of that array
# to the word that the Anagram class is initialized with.
# To determine if they are anagrams, try determining if they are
# composed of the same letters. Remember that you can split a word into an array
# of letters using some_word.split(""). You can compare two arrays using the ==. For example:


def self.match(words)
